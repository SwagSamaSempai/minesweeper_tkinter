# Text Revealing Minesweeper

## Description

This simple Minesweeper application lets you play the timeless classic
game. Use left click to check a cell for a bomb, and right click to
flag a cell as a bomb.

There is however a small addition. By giving it a text file, you can
hide a text behind the bombs, that reveals itself as you progress in
the game.

## Requirements

 - Python 3.9
 - tkinter

## Notes

There are two versions, the normal one (`Minesweeper.py`), and the
recursive one (`Minesweeper_rec.py`). I'm too lazy to check which one
is the most optimized, sorry. >:)
